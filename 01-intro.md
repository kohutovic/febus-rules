# Introduction

The goal of this event is to assess fencing in a safe and friendly manner on the principle of 'to
touch without being touched'. In common with historical rule-sets, competitions are explicitly an
abstracted test of skill, and not a simulation of an unregulated combat “to the finish” – in this
sense, we shall regard each individual point as a separate "duel" within the framework of the
following rules, the loss of which is indicated by having a point called against the losing fencer.
Our intention is to determine the relative ranking, and the best fencer among the competitors
present on the days of the competitions, in terms of tactical, technical, and athletic skills.

One of the principles which stand above all others is the principle of fair play. Every functional
ruleset should be efficient in providing equal opportunities for every tournament contestant.

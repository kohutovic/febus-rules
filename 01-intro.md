# Introduction

The goal of this event is to assess fencing in a safe and friendly
manner on the principle of 'to touch without being touched'. In common
with historical rule-sets, competitions are explicitly an abstracted
test of skill, and not a simulation of an unregulated combat “to the
finish” – in this sense, we shall regard each individual point as a
separate "duel" within the framework of the following rules, the loss of
which is indicated by having a point called against the losing fencer.
Our intention is to determine the relative ranking, and the best fencer
among the competitors present on the days of the competitions, in terms
of tactical, technical, and athletic skills.

One of the principles which stand above all others is the principle of
fair play. Every functional ruleset should be efficient in providing
equal opportunities for every tournament contestant.

# Technical & Equipment Standards

## Fencing Arena

## Equipment standards

1. Every contestant is responsible for their equipment, and must use each element of the mandatory
   equipment, when entering a tournament. If a piece of equipment is declared unsuitable or unfit
   and the contestant is unable to get a suitable substitute they will be prohibited from entering
   the tournament.

2. The mandatory equipment is controlled by the designated tournament staff before the competition
   and an additional check must be done by the referee of each fencing arena. A referee may require

   than 5 minutes. If it is not possible for the contestant to comply within the set time frame, the
   contestant will be awarded a black card and won’t be able to continue in the respective
   tournament.

3. In case of an accident caused by unfit or inadequate equipment approved negligently by the
   equipment check staff or the referee, the responsibility lies with the staff or referee, who
   approved the contestant’s entry. The staff or the referee will be subjected to disciplinary
   proceedings and their license may be revoked.

# Appendix: Vor/Priority refined

1. The fencer who is attacked is alone counted as hit:
   1. if he makes a counter-attack on his opponent’s simple attack
   2. if, instead of parrying, he attempts to avoid the hit and does not succeed in doing so
   3. if, after making a successful parry, he makes a momentary pause (delayed riposte) which gives
      his opponent the right to renew the attack (redoublement, or remise, or reprise)
   4. if, during a compound attack, he makes a stop hit without being in time
   5. if, having his point ‘in line’ and being subjected to a beat or a taking of the blade which
      deflects his blade, he attacks or places his point in line again instead of parrying a direct
      hit made by his opponent

2. The fencer who attacks is alone counted as hit:
   1. If he initiated his attack when his opponent had his point ‘in line’, without deflecting the
      opponent’s weapon. Referees must ensure that a mere contact of the blades is not considered as
      sufficient to deflect the opponent’s blade.
   2. If he attempts to find the blade, does not succeed (due to the opponent's avoiding reaction)
      and continues the attack.
   3. If, during a compound attack, he allows his opponent to find the blade, and continues the
      attack while his opponent ripostes immediately.
   4. If, during a compound attack, he bends his arm or makes a momentary pause, during which time
      the opponent makes a stop hit or an attack while the attacker continues his own attack.
   5. If, during a compound attack, he is stop-hit one period of fencing time before he makes his
      final movement.
   6. If he makes a hit by a renewed attack following a parry by his opponent which has been
      followed by a riposte which is immediate, simple and executed in one period of fencing time
      without withdrawing the arm.

3. Both fencers are counted as hit:
   1. Similar conception and execution of the same action by both fencers at once, without either of
      them taking the initiative sooner than the other.
   2. Similar failure to initiate or execute the appropriate actions, of both fencers at the same
      time, resulting in the loss of priority gained by previous actions, and without any of the
      fencers taking the initiative sooner than the other afterwards.

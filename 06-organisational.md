# Organisational Rules

1. The competition is open to athletes of 18 years and older.

2. It is prohibited to enter a competition under the influence of
   alcohol or performance-altering drugs (including recreational drugs
   and those prescribed by physicians).

## The Refereeing system

### Main Referee

1.  The Referee works with an Assistant (side Referee) and manages the
    time and protocol (when necessary, supported by an administrative
    crew).

2.  The Referee gives the signals to start, stop, assigns points and
    describes what happened during the entire assault or at least the
    last exchange.

3.  After stopping the bout, the Referee consults with the Assistant and
    proposes a result. If the fencers accept the decision (they say
    nothing), the fight continues with the proposed score. If they don’t
    agree with the Referee, but they agree with each other, the Referee
    may make a decision according to their wishes. If any of the fencers
    protests and the fencers disagree with each other, the Referee will
    decide whether to assign a point (being completely sure) or repeat
    the assault.

4.  If the Referee is unable to interpret the fencing phrase for some
    reason, they can repeat the exchange but will explain and
    apologise.

5.  The Referee's decisions can not be contested after the bout.

### Side Referee (Assistant Referee)

1. An Assistant Referee helps the main Referee in scoring and hit
   evaluation. Their task is to observe a match from a different angle
   than the main Referee.

2. The Assistant may signal hits made by the fencers to the Referee by
   raising their arm, even if the Referee does not halt the assault immediately.

3. An Assistant Referee is not responsible for point assignment nor for
   the overall match score.

## Organisation of the competitions and classification

### The round of pools

1.  In all competitions for which the formula includes a round of pools,
    these pools will consist of 7 fencers if the number of participants
    is divisible by 7. Otherwise the pools will be of 7 and 6 fencers.

2.  In the pools a bout ends when:
    1. One of the fencers has scored 5 hits. In this case the score
       registered on the score- sheet is the final score of the bout (V5
       – Dn, where n = the number of hits scored by the losing fencer).
    2. Three minutes of effective fencing time have passed. (There is no
       warning for the last minute.)

3.  If when the time limit expires there is a difference of at least one
    point between the scores of the two fencers, the fencer who has
    scored the greater number of hits is declared winner. The score
    registered on the score-sheet is the actual score achieved in the
    bout (VN – Dn, where N = the number of hits scored by the winning
    fencer and n = the number of hits scored by the losing fencer).

4.  If at the end of regulation time the scores are equal, the fencers
    fence for a deciding hit, with a maximum time limit of one minute.
    Before the fencing recommences, the Referee draws lots to decide who
    will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra
    minute.

5.  In this case the score registered on the score-sheet is always the
    actual score achieved in the bout:
    1. VN–Dn if a deciding hit is scored within the time limit for the
       bout.
    2. V4–D4 or V3–D3 or V2–D2 or V1–D1 or V0–D0 if the winner is
       designated by drawing lots.
    3. Vn-DN, VN-Dn or Vn-Dn in case a single bout is forfeited due to
       injury or equipment malfunction but the rest of the bouts have
       been completed regularly. It is always the fencer who did not
       forfeit the bout who is registered as victorious, even though the
       scores are not annulled.
    4. V0-D0 in case a fencer is withdrawn or removed from the
       competition, marking the opponent as the winner, but not
       registering any scores, for all of the fencer’s bouts in the
       pool..

6.  Before the competition starts, the Organising Team will decide on and announce the number of fencers who will be
    eliminated based on the ranking established by the pools (0-40%).

7.  After the pools, a single general ranking will be established of all
    the fencers who have taken part in the pools, taking account,
    successively, of the indices V/M, HS – HR, HS. (V = victories; M =
    bouts; HS = hits scored; HR = hits received.)

8.  A summary classification table shall then be made in the following
    way:
    1. The results written up on the summary table will be added up to
       ascertain the two indices required.
    2. The first index, for the initial classification, shall be
       obtained by dividing the number of victories by the number of
       bouts fought, using the formula V/M.
    3. The fencer with the highest index (maximum 1) will be seeded
       first.
    4. In cases of equality in this first index, and to separate fencers
       with equal first indices, a second index will be established,
       using the formula HS – HR, the difference between the total
       number of hits scored and hits received.
    5. In cases of equality of the two indices V/M and HS – HR, the
       fencer who has scored most hits will be seeded highest.
    6. In cases of absolute equality between two or more fencers, their
       seeding order will be decided by drawing lots.

9.  Should there be absolute equality among the last to qualify there
    will not be a barrage, and the fencers with equal indicators will
    all qualify, even if they are in excess of the number decided on.

10. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the
    pool, His/her results are recorded as if all of their opponents had
    won against the fencer, but no score will be registered (V0-D0). The
    fencer who is withdrawn or excluded during the pool, will not be
    included in the calculation of the ranking for the direct
    elimination table.

11. When a fencer withdraws from one pool bout only, they are declared
    as having lost the bout, but the score established before is not
    annulled.

## The direct elimination

1.  The direct elimination table (bout plan) – complete or incomplete –
    is established taking account of the classification table and the
    special rules for each competition (See Figure 2.)

2.  The organisers of a competition publish the direct elimination bout
    plan. The direct elimination bouts are for 7 hits or end when the
    two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between the two
    periods, have passed.

3.  During the one-minute rest a second/coach, named before the bout,
    may have access to the fencer.

4.  The bout ends when:
    1. One of the fencers has scored 7 hits; or
    2. 2 * 3 minutes of effective fencing time have passed.

5.  The fencer who has scored the greater number of hits is declared the
    winner.

6.  If at the end of regulation time the scores are equal, the fencers
    fence for a deciding hit, with a maximum time limit of one minute.
    Before the fencing recommences the Referee draws lots to decide who
    will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra
    minute. In this case the score recorded on the score-sheet is the
    real score achieved in the bout.

7.  Withdrawal: When, for whatever reason, a fencer cannot fence, or
    cannot complete their bout, their opponent is declared winner of that
    bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose their place in the overall
    classification of the competition.

## Order of bouts

1. In each round of the direct elimination table (256, 128, 64, 32, 16,
   8 or 4), the bouts are always called in the order of the bout plan,
   starting at the top and ending at the bottom.

## Classification

1. The general classification is obtained as follows:
   1. First: the winner of the bout for the first place
   2. Second: the loser of the bout for the first place
   3. A bout for third and fourth places will be fought between the two
      losers of the semi-final matches.
   4. The remainder are placed, within each round of the direct
      elimination, in accordance with their classification for the
      composition of the direct elimination table.

## Tournament Staff

1. Medical/paramedic staff will assess possible injury/illness of the
   participants during/after bouts and advise on immediate management.

2. The head of the Organising Team is responsible for the overall smooth
   running of the tournament. The Organising Team is available for
   questions, complaints, compliments, and suggestions, before during
   and after the event.

3. The head of the Refereeing Team oversees the allocation and
   performance of the Referees and Assistants. The Refereeing committee
   can be approached directly by the participants or their
   representatives, if questions regarding the performance of any of the
   Referees are raised.

4. The head of Equipment Inspection performs pre-tournament checks of
   safety equipment and weapons, stamps passed items and keeps a list
   of participants whose safety equipment has been deemed satisfactory.

5. The Technical Team manages the technical infrastructure, including
   the competition management software, ensuring that the events are
   recorded, stored, displayed correctly.

## Rules of hit validity and fencing actions

1. All hits made with the true edge, the false edge, and the tip of the blade are valid if they are
   performed in such a way that it would have caused a wound to an unarmoured opponent, had the
   weapon been sharp. Hits performed with the flat may be counted, if they bear the characteristics
   of a coordinated and potent technique. It is up to the referee’s discretion to judge the validity
   of hits.

2. Hits through the blade, that is to say those which bend over the opponent’s blade or cross-guard,
   are not considered to be valid. However, the referee may count a hit as valid, if the opponent’s
   blade has not closed the line of the attack, and it touches at the same time the valid target and
   the weapon of the opponent, whenever they arrive clearly on the target.

3. The target includes the whole of the fencer’s body, including the handle of the weapon, clothing,
   and safety equipment, except for the back of the head, spine, the feet, and the back of the
   knees.

4. Hits performed with the pommel may only count as valid if performed on the uncovered mesh part of
   the opponent's mask; to any other targets they don't count as valid.

## *Vor* (priority)

1.  The Referee alone decides as to the validity or the priority (*Vor*) of the hit by applying the
    following basic rules which are the conventions applicable to longsword fencing.

2.  Any attack properly executed must be parried, or completely avoided, and the phrase must be
    continuous.

3.  The attack is correctly carried out when the straightening of the arm, with the point or the
    edge continuously threatening the valid target, precedes the initiation of the footwork action.

4.  An attack with a lunge (or other offensive footwork) is correctly carried out:
    1. in a simple attack when the beginning of the straightening of the arms precedes the launching
       of the lunge or other offensive footwork, and the hit arrives at the latest when the front
       foot hits the ground
    2. in a compound attack when the beginning of the straightening of the arms, on the first feint,
       precedes the launching of the lunge or other offensive footwork, and the hit arrives at the
       latest when the front foot hits the ground.

5.  Attacks with step-forward-lunge or other compound footwork are not defined in this rulebook.
    Priority is assigned based on the start of the (attack with) lunge other simple offensive
    footwork, while steps in any case are considered as preparations.

6.  Actions, simple or compound, steps or feints, which are executed with bent arms, are not
    considered as attacks but as preparations, laying themselves open to the initiation of the
    offensive or defensive/offensive action of the opponent. Hits received from
    attacks/counterattacks initiated during these actions are counted as valid and score a point
    against the preparing fencer.

7.  In order to judge as to the correctness of an attack the following points must be considered:
    1. If the attack is initiated when the opponent has their point passively in Langort (‘in line’)
       the attacker must first deflect the opponent’s weapon. Referees must ensure that a mere
       contact of the blades is not considered as sufficient to deflect the opponent’s blade.
    2. If, when attempting to find the opponent’s blade to deflect it, the blade is not found, the
       right of attack passes to the opponent.
    3. If the attack is commenced when the opponent’s blade is not in Langort, the attack may be
       completed either direct, or by a disengagement or by a cutover, or else be preceded by feints
       which oblige the opponent to parry.
    4. In a compound attack the opponent has the right to stop-hit; but, in order to be valid, the
       stop hit must precede the last movement of the attack by one period of fencing time, i.e. the
       stop hit must arrive before the attacker has started the last movement of the attack itself.

8.  The parry - properly carried out - gives the right to riposte; a simple riposte may be direct or
    indirect, but in order to annul any subsequent movement by the attacker, it must be carried out
    immediately, *without any hesitation or pause*. However, if the riposte is delayed so that a
    renewed attack clearly starts before the riposte, then the renewed attack gains priority.

9.  Against thrusts, and cuts with the edge, the flat, or the back edge of the blade, the object of
    the parry is to prevent hits made by the opponent arriving on the valid target; therefore:
    1. The parry is properly carried out when, before the completion of the attack, it prevents the
       arrival of that attack by closing the line in which that attack is to finish.
    2. When a parry is properly executed, the attack by the opponent must be declared parried, and
       judged as such by the Referee, even if, as a result of its flexibility, the tip of the
       opponent’s weapon makes contact with the target.

10. Detailed examples and descriptions for application of Vor rule are described
    [Appendix: Vor/Priority](appendices/02-priority.md)

## Close quarter combat

1. Priority ceases to exist when the weapons of the opponents come together at *Stercke* on
   *Stercke* (including the crossguard), and/or in case of grappling actions. In case the weapons
   touch *Stercke* on *Stercke*, and a double hit follows immediately, both fencers are called a
   point against. Otherwise, they may disengage and continue fencing (with priority rules), or enter
   grappling (with grappling rules).

## Judging of hits

1.  When during a phrase both fencers are hit within a period of fencing time there is either a
    simultaneous action or a double hit:
    1. The simultaneous action is due to simultaneous conception and execution of an attack by both
       fencers; in this case both fencers are called a point against.
    2. The double hit on the other hand, is the result of a clearly faulty action on the part of one
       of the fencers, according to the rules. Therefore, when there is not an interval of fencing
       time between the hits.

2.  When there is a double hit, and if the Referee is unable clearly to judge from which side the
    fault has come, the referee must not assign any points.

3.  In cases when a stop hit is made and there is doubt as to whether it was made sufficiently in
    time in relation to the final movement of a compound attack, the double hit often occurs through
    the fault of both fencers concerned. Since this is clearly not a tactically symmetrical case,
    the referee should assign no points. (The fault of the attacker consists of indecision, slowness
    of execution or the making of feints which are not sufficiently effective. The fault of the
    defender lies in delay or slowness in making the stop hit.)

4.  Any actions executed while holding the weapon with one hand only, can only score if the fencer
    does not receive any attack or counterattack with a weapon held with two hands, within one
    period of fencing time.

5.  However if the opponent reacts to the attack with a weapon held in one hand with an attempt to
    parry, an unsuccessful parry returns the right of initiative to the one-handed hit.

6.  In cases when both fencers get hit with a weapon held in one hand within time, the judgment of
    the action follows the regular priority rules.

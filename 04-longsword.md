## Rules of hit validity and fencing actions

1. All hits made with the true edge, the false edge, and the tip of the
   blade are valid if they are performed in such a way that it would
   have caused a wound to an unarmoured opponent, had the weapon been
   sharp. Hits performed with the flat may be counted, if they bear the
   characteristics of a coordinated and potent technique. It is up to
   the referee’s discretion to judge the validity of hits.

2. Hits through the blade, that is to say those which bend over the
   opponent’s blade or cross-guard, are not considered to be valid.
   However, the referee may count a hit as valid, if the opponent’s
   blade has not closed the line of the attack, and it touches at the
   same time the valid target and the weapon of the opponent, whenever
   they arrive clearly on the target.

3. The target includes the whole of the fencer’s body, including the
   handle of the weapon, clothing, and safety equipment, except for the
   back of the head, spine, the feet, and the back of the knees.

4. Hits performed with the pommel may only count as valid if performed
   on the uncovered mesh part of the opponent's mask; to any other
   targets they don't count as valid.

## *Vor* (priority)

1.  The Referee alone decides as to the validity or the priority (*Vor*)
    of the hit by applying the following basic rules which are the
    conventions applicable to longsword fencing.

2.  Any attack properly executed must be parried, or completely avoided,
    and the phrase must be continuous.

3.  The attack is correctly carried out when the straightening of the
    arm, with the point or the edge continuously threatening the valid
    target, precedes the initiation of the footwork action.

4.  An attack with a lunge (or other offensive footwork) is correctly
    carried out:
    1. in a simple attack when the beginning of the straightening of the
       arms precedes the launching of the lunge or other offensive
       footwork, and the hit arrives at the latest when the front foot
       hits the ground
    2. in a compound attack when the beginning of the straightening of
       the arms, on the first feint, precedes the launching of the lunge
       or other offensive footwork, and the hit arrives at the latest
       when the front foot hits the ground.

5.  Attacks with step-forward-lunge or other compound footwork are not
    defined in this rulebook. Priority is assigned based on the start of
    the (attack with) lunge other simple offensive footwork, while steps
    in any case are considered as preparations.

6.  Actions, simple or compound, steps or feints, which are executed
    with bent arms, are not considered as attacks but as preparations,
    laying themselves open to the initiation of the offensive or
    defensive/offensive action of the opponent. Hits received from
    attacks/counterattacks initiated during these actions are counted as
    valid and score a point against the preparing fencer.

7.  In order to judge as to the correctness of an attack the following
    points must be considered:
    1. If the attack is initiated when the opponent has their point
       passively in Langort (‘in line’) the attacker must first deflect
       the opponent’s weapon. Referees must ensure that a mere contact
       of the blades is not considered as sufficient to deflect the
       opponent’s blade.
    2. If, when attempting to find the opponent’s blade to deflect it,
       the blade is not found, the right of attack passes to the
       opponent.
    3. If the attack is commenced when the opponent’s blade is not in
       Langort, the attack may be completed either direct, or by a
       disengagement or by a cutover, or else be preceded by feints
       which oblige the opponent to parry.
    4. In a compound attack the opponent has the right to stop-hit; but,
       in order to be valid, the stop hit must precede the last movement
       of the attack by one period of fencing time, i.e. the stop hit
       must arrive before the attacker has started the last movement of
       the attack itself.

8.  The parry - properly carried out - gives the right to riposte; a
    simple riposte may be direct or indirect, but in order to annul any
    subsequent movement by the attacker, it must be carried out
    immediately, *without any hesitation or pause*. However, if the
    riposte is delayed so that a renewed attack clearly starts before
    the riposte, then the renewed attack gains priority.

9.  Against thrusts, and cuts with the edge, the flat, or the back edge
    of the blade, the object of the parry is to prevent hits made by the
    opponent arriving on the valid target; therefore:
    1. The parry is properly carried out when, before the completion of
       the attack, it prevents the arrival of that attack by closing the
       line in which that attack is to finish.
    2. When a parry is properly executed, the attack by the opponent
       must be declared parried, and judged as such by the Referee, even
       if, as a result of its flexibility, the tip of the opponent’s
       weapon makes contact with the target.

10. Detailed examples and descriptions for application of Vor rule are
    described [Appendix: Vor/Priority](appendices/02-priority.md)

## Close quarter combat

1. Priority ceases to exist when the weapons of the opponents come
   together at *Stercke* on *Stercke* (including the crossguard), and/or
   in case of grappling actions. In case the weapons touch *Stercke* on
   *Stercke*, and a double hit follows immediately, both fencers are
   called a point against. Otherwise, they may disengage and continue
   fencing (with priority rules), or enter grappling (with grappling
   rules).

## Judging of hits

1.  When during a phrase both fencers are hit within a period of fencing
    time there is either a simultaneous action or a double hit:
    1. The simultaneous action is due to simultaneous conception and
       execution of an attack by both fencers; in this case both fencers
       are called a point against.
    2. The double hit on the other hand, is the result of a clearly
       faulty action on the part of one of the fencers, according to the
       rules. Therefore, when there is not an interval of fencing time
       between the hits.

2.  When there is a double hit, and if the Referee is unable clearly to
    judge from which side the fault has come, the referee must
    not assign any points.

3.  In cases when a stop hit is made and there is doubt as to whether it
    was made sufficiently in time in relation to the final movement of a
    compound attack, the double hit often occurs through the fault of
    both fencers concerned. Since this is clearly not a tactically
    symmetrical case, the referee should assign no points. (The fault of
    the attacker consists of indecision, slowness of execution or the
    making of feints which are not sufficiently effective. The fault of
    the defender lies in delay or slowness in making the stop hit.)

4.  Any actions executed while holding the weapon with one hand only,
    can only score if the fencer does not receive any attack or
    counterattack with a weapon held with two hands, within one period
    of fencing time.

5.  However if the opponent reacts to the attack with a weapon held in
    one hand with an attempt to parry, an unsuccessful parry returns the
    right of initiative to the one-handed hit.

6.  In cases when both fencers get hit with a weapon held in one hand
    within time, the judgment of the action follows the regular priority
    rules.

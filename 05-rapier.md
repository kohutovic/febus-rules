# Rapier and side weapons competitions

## Wrestling

1. Wrestling actions (arm locks, throws, chokes) are forbidden in Rapier and Side Weapons
   competitions.

2. Attempting wrestling actions during bouts of this category belongs to the first group of
   offences.

3. Body contact (including accidental jostling) in itself is not considered as wrestling and
   therefore are allowed.

## Judging of hits

1. A double hit occurs when two valid hits that land within one period of fencing time.

2. When a double hit consists of a thrust by one fencer and a cut or slice by the other, the thrust
   scores one point and the cut scores no point.

3. In all other double hits, each fencer scores one point.

4. A hit that begins at or after the moment a fencer receives a valid hit (after-action) is not
   counted.

5. Rapiers may be used with a parrying dagger or a cloak; the regulations for these side weapons are
   set out elsewhere in this Rulebook.

6. All hits made with the point, and the edges of the blade, are valid. The action must be
   performed in such a way that it would have caused a wound to an unarmoured opponent, had the
   weapon been sharp. Hits performed with the flat may be counted, if they are aimed at the head,
   and bear the characteristics of a coordinated and potent technique. It is up to the referee’s
   discretion to judge the validity of hits, in accordance with the Rulebook’s regulations.

7. The target includes the whole of the fencer’s body, clothing, and safety equipment, except for
   the back of the head, spine, the feet, the back of the knees, and if used, the cloak.

8. Hits performed with the pommel to other parts than the uncovered mesh part of the opponent's
   mask are not penalised but also gain no point.

9. It is allowed to parry using the unarmed hand, as long as the weapon is controlled (thrusts or
   static blade positions, where the parrying hand does not get a direct hit).

10. Switching of the weapon hand is allowed only in case of injury of the original armed hand,
    disallowing to continue fencing with the same hand. Switching the hands in any other case or
    holding the rapier with two hands is not permitted.

## Actions involving a dagger as a side weapon

1. It is allowed to parry with the dagger, as long as it is used for defensive actions only.

2. It is allowed to engage the opponent’s blade using the dagger

3. It is forbidden to attack with the dagger, and depending on the outcome, it may belong to the
   first or the second group of offences.

4. It is forbidden to throw the dagger at the opponent, it belongs to the fourth group of offences,
   and will be penalized with elimination from the tournament.

## Actions involving a cloak as a side weapon

1. It is allowed to parry with the cloak, as long as it is used for defensive actions only.

2. It is allowed to engage the opponent’s blade using the cloak.

3. Cuts aimed at the cloak-covered hand or body or the cloak itself are not considered valid.

4. Thrusts aimed at the cloak-covered hand or body are considered valid, as long as the thrust hits
   a valid target through the cloak and satisfies the general requirements of valid attacks.

5. It is forbidden to throw the cloak at the opponent. It must be wrapped around the unarmed hand.
   Dropping or letting go of the cloak without the opponent’s interaction belongs to the first
   group of offences.

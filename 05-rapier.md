## Rules of hit validity

1.  Rapiers can be used with a parrying dagger or a cloak. The regulations regarding these
    equipments can be found in the Rulebook.

2.  All hits made with the point, and the edges of the blade, are valid. The action must be
    performed in such a way that it would have caused a wound to an unarmoured opponent, had the
    weapon been sharp. Hits performed with the flat may be counted, if they are aimed at the head,
    and bear the characteristics of a coordinated and potent technique. It is up to the referee’s
    discretion to judge the validity of hits, in accordance with the Rulebook’s regulations.

3.  The target includes the whole of the fencer’s body, clothing, and safety equipment, except for
    the back of the head, spine, the feet, the back of the knees, and if used, the cloak.

4.  Hits performed with the pommel to other parts than the uncovered mesh part of the opponent's
    mask are not penalised but also gain no point.

5.  It is allowed to parry using the unarmed hand, as long as the weapon is controlled (thrusts or
    static blade positions, where the parrying hand does not get a direct hit).

6.  Switching of the weapon hand is allowed only in case of injury of the original armed hand,
    disallowing to continue fencing with the same hand. Switching the hands in any other case or
    holding the rapier with two hands is not permitted.

3.  Cuts aimed at the cloak covered hand or body or the cloak itself are not considered valid.

    valid target through the cloak, and satisfies the general requirements of valid attacks.
